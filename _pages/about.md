Welcome to my page! It's still :nut_and_bolt: under construction :nut_and_bolt: but make yourself at home! 

I am a MSc. student enrolled in the international program in [Physics of Complex Systems](http://www.pcs.polito.it). I am moving my first steps in graduate studies and reasearch. 

My interest relies in the study of Complex Systems with a particular focus on Network Science and Higher-Order systems.

As part of my BSc. in Physics at [Universit√† degli Studi di Torino](https://fisica.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl) I carried out an internship at [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it/en/home) under the supervision of [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io). At ISI I studied higher-order contagions, focusing in particular on modeling the effects of interactions between pathogens. The results of this work are presented in my [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/thomasrobiglio/SimplicialInteractingContagion/blob/main/tesi_presentazione_robiglio.pdf) (only in italian, sorry) and in a paper currently under review (preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07645)).
