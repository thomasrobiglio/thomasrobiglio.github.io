Hello there!

I am a PhD student in Network Science at the [Department of Network and Data Science at CEU](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu). I am moving my first steps into graduate studies and research. Previously, I obtained my MSc. degree in [Physics of Complex Systems](http://www.pcs.polito.it) from Politecnico di Torino and Sorbonne Université.

My interest relies in the study of complex systems using tools from network science and statistical physics with a particular focus on inferential methods and higher-order systems.

I work under the supervision of [Tiago P. Peixoto](https://skewed.de/tiago/) and [Márton Karsai](https://www.martonkarsai.com) on the formulation of generative models for temporal networks and the application of network inference methods to the analysis of internal migrations in Austria.

**Previous affiliations and supervisors:**
- [Centre de Physique Théorique](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr), Marseille, FRA. [Alain Barrat](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~barrat/) and Mathieu Génois.
- [NPL group](https://nplresearch.github.io) at CENTAI, [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it), Torino, ITA. [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io).
- Dept. of Physics, UniTO, Torino, ITA. Matteo Osella.
