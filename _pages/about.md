Welcome to my page!

I am a PhD student in Network Science at the [Department of Network and Data Science at CEU](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu). I am moving my first steps into graduate studies and reasearch. Previously, I obtained my MSc. degree in [Physics of Complex Systems](http://www.pcs.polito.it) from Politecnico di Torino and Sorbonne Université.

My interest relies in the study of Complex Systems using tools from network science and statistical physics with a particular focus on inferential methods and higher-order systems.

I work under the supervision of [Tiago P. Peixoto](https://skewed.de/tiago/) and [Márton Karsai](https://www.martonkarsai.com) on the application of generative models for temporal networks and the application of network inference methods to the analysis of internal migrations in Austria.
