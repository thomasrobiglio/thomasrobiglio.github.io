Hello there!

I am a PhD student in Complex Systems and Network Science at [IT:U, Interdisciplinary Transformation University - Austria](https://it-u.at/en/). I am moving my first steps into graduate studies and research. I am also completing a MPhil. in Network Science at the [Department of Network and Data Science](https://www.ceu.edu/unit/dnds).

My interest relies in the study of complex systems using tools from network science and statistical physics with a particular focus on [inferential methods](https://skewed.de/lab/research.html) and higher-order systems.

I work under the supervision of [Tiago P. Peixoto](https://skewed.de/tiago/) on the formulation of generative models for temporal networks and the application of network inference methods to the analysis of [internal migrations in Austria](https://moma.science).

**Previous affiliations and supervisors:**
- [Centre de Physique Théorique](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr), Marseille, FRA. [Alain Barrat](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~barrat/) and Mathieu Génois.
- [NPL group](https://nplresearch.github.io) at CENTAI, [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it), Torino, ITA. [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io).
- Dept. of Physics, UniTO, Torino, ITA. Matteo Osella.
