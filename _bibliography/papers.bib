   abstract = {Single contagion processes are known to display a continuous transition from an epidemic-free phase at low contagion rates to the epidemic state for rates above a critical threshold. This transition can become discontinuous when two simple contagion processes are coupled in a bi-directional symmetric way. However, in many cases, the coupling is not symmetric and the processes can be of a different nature. For example, social behaviors -- such as hand-washing or mask-wearing -- can affect the spread of a disease, and their adoption dynamics via social reinforcement mechanisms are better described by complex contagion models, rather than by the simple contagion paradigm, which is more appropriate for disease spreading phenomena. Motivated by this example, we consider a simplicial contagion (describing the adoption of a behavior) that uni-directionally drives a simple contagion (describing a disease propagation). We show that, above a critical driving strength, such driven simple contagion can exhibit both discontinuous transitions and bi-stability, which are instead absent in standard simple contagions. We provide a mean-field analytical description of the phase diagram of the system, and complement the results with Markov-chain simulations. Our results provide a novel route for a simple contagion process to display the phenomenology of a higher-order contagion, through a driving mechanism that may be hidden or unobservable in many practical instances.},

abstract = {Complex networks are currently used to study diffusion phenomena of various types: the collective manifestation of a disease, the adoption of a trend or the circulation of news - in populations of agents that interact with each other. In the most common models, only pairwise contacts between the agents represented by the links of the network are considered. However group dynamics play an important role in social contagion phenomena. These dynamics can be studied by introducing contagion routes linked to higher-order structures in the network. The presence and interaction of different pathogens within the same population constitutes is non-negligible in the study of real contagion phenomena: the comorbidity between two infections, the competition between different strains of the same disease or the influence of social behaviors (e.g. prevention policies or risky behaviors by agents) can significantly modify the epidemic dynamics of the system and show phenomenologies unobserved if the interaction is neglected. In this thesis a SIS model of contagion on simplicial complexes is developed and, with a mean-field approach and through simulations, we analyze the consequences of the interaction (collaborative or competitive) between two pathogens.}}
